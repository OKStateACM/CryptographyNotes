# Cryptography

## What is Cryptography
* Definition: Converting some plain text into cipher text through mathematical equations
* Used for making sure that even if an attacker gets to information, it looks like gibberish without the decryption key
* Three main concepts in industry cryptography
  * Hashes
  * Symmetric cryptography
  * Asymmetric cryptography

## Ciphers
* A means of putting something into a secret code by means of an algorithm
* For example, a [Caesar cipher](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher), which is one of the first and most basic forms of cipher. It assigns each letter of the alphabet to a number, A=1 B=2 C=3 etc., and utilizes a set numerical key added to the number values of each letter.
* In industry you will not write your own encryption algorithms. You will use ones that have been written and thoroughly tested by researchers. This ensures it will be secure and statistically impossible to crack (ex. MD5, SHA 1)
